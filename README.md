# Google Photo search by date

## A consistent Google photo search by date

Google Photo search by date has become fuzzy.

I'm not sure since when but searching by date returns unexpected results.

Instead of matching the exact date it seems to match part of the date (e.g. searching for 21/11/2019 might return 21/06/2019 by matching the only the day)

This project is a quick and dirty workaround to search photos by exact date.
