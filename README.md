# Google Photo search by date

## A consistent Google photo search by date

The search in https://photos.google.com, when searching by date, has become somewhat fuzzy and inconsistent, it works at times, it seems to cache previous searches but fail miserably on some dates.

I'm not sure when this has changed but searching by date recently returns unexpected results.

In fact, it often does not match the exact date but it does some fuzzy maching, e.g. using part of the date in the query. 

As an example, searching for 21/11/2019 might return media items from 21/06/2019 by matching  only the day part and not the exact date)


This project is a workaround to search photos by exact date, nothing fancy, just provides an ability to do date searches on Google Photos.
